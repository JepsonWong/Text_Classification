　　Abstract　Sitting on the circum-Pacific Ocean seismic belt,Hebei Province is one of the most earthquake disaster-prone prov inces in our country.The deaths and losses caused by earthquake are imponderable .According to the analysis of earthquake disaster vulnerability of Zhangbei-Shan gyi,this thesis points out that the key to understand and mitigate earthquake di saster is the vulnerability embedded in local social life.Minimizing vulnerabili ty according to adjustment of unsuitable human activities in daily life and prod uctive process is the most effective way in the reduction of earthquake disaster s.

　　During this century,some 1.5 million people have been killed in earthquakes all over the world.Among them,about 250 thousand (about 1/6 total) were in Hebei Province while several times as many as that have suffered serious injuries and more have their houses destroyed.Sitting on the circum-Pacific Ocean seismic belt and having experienced many times of diastrophism,great deep ruptures exist in mo untain foot areas and plain where economy is relatively developed.Earthquakes occur frequen tly.Just since the founding of People′s Republic of China(1949),out of 49 years there have been 11 years when happened earthquakes over 4.5 Rechter scale,among which Tangshan (July 28,1976,7.8 Rechter scale) and Xingtai (March 8,1966,7.2 Rechter scale) earthquake disaster killed 240 thousand and 8064 people respectively,and made Hebei Province the most heaviest disastous area in the world history.The economic losses and social impacts from earthquake disa sters are imponderable.So it is aecessary to analyse the earthquake vulnerability and carry out human adjustment and adaptation to earthquakes to the mitigate an d reducte earthquake disasters.It is also very important for the stability and sustainable development of society and economic developments.
　　In developed countries,a great many earthquakes of potential damaging scale occu rred without giving rise to disasters.In fact,actual destruction and casual ties always depend upon the presence and character of human settlement and land uses.This largely reflects that the vulnerability is a function of human activ ity and socioeconomic conditions and may or may not be associated with earthquak edanger and risk reducing practices.
1　Vulnerability perspective
1.1　Concept of vulnerability
　　Vulnerability refers to the property or circumstance of persons,activities,socia l assets and sites that is susceptible to harm and loss from environmental hazar ds〔2〕.
　　It is the state of powerlessness in the face of a known or unknown hazard.(O′Ri o rdan,1990), has been regarded as a measure of loss and as a measure of exposure to loss (UNDRO,1982).Vulnerability can be thought of as the other face of safety or security.Increased vulnerability means decreased safety.
1.2　Vulnerability perspective
　　Over the past decade or so,the idea of vulnerability has come to identify a di stinctive view of risk and disaster. Different from hazard perspectiv e which emphasizes the strength of natural agents on the role of hum an actions,vulnerability perspective emphasizes how communities are exposed to dangers of become unsafe,rather than the characteristics of natural or technologica lagents.When people are in danger,the conditions that influence their protection and coping capacities are the main concern,rather than the severity of a damagi ng agent.When disasters do occur,the focus is especially upon who is affected and their ability to withstand,mitigate and recover from damage〔2〕.
　　In vulnerability perspective,almost all natural disasters are the outcomes of na tural hazards impinging on vulnerable populations,social assets and activity sit es. Earthquake disasters are not exceptions.Earthquake is just a trigger,while earth q uake disaster is the actualization of vulnerability embedded in everyday life.H ence it is the vulnerability that determines the degree of certain disaster.Acco rding to Blaikie′s conceptual model PAR〔3〕(pressure and release),D=H+V( Di saster is the result of complex mixture of Hazard and Vulnerability).Both natura l hazards and vulnerability produce pressure on disaster undertakers.When the pr essure threshold is broken through,disaster would follow.Given a certain magnitu de of hazard,more vulnerable the society is,lower the threshold will be and more easily disaster will occur.
　　Broadly saying,any form of disaster is affected by four sets of influences.The yare hazards,vulnerability and adaptability,intervening conditions of danger,and human coping and adjustments〔2〕.Although earthquake hazard might not be predicted precisely or delimited effectively due to its complex mechanism at p resent time and worldwidely,human could do a lot in earthquake disaster mitigati on an d reduction by reducing vulnerability through rational adjustments and measures. 
1.3　Vulnerability affecting factors and its forms
　　Vulnerability could be expressed in many different aspects.They are〔2〕 : 
　　(1) Exposure to hazards: through occupation,life-style,location;
　　(2) Weakness and susceptibility: predisposition,disability,poor design and quali ty of buildings,insecure practices;
　　(3) Disadvantage or ‘structural weakness’: poverty,dependency,lack of capabili ties and rights;
　　(4) Lack of resource capabilities: limited and impaired resilience,actual or org anized options,creative responses ;
　　(5) Powerlessness: inability to influence source of danger or protection;
　　(6) Enforced vulnerability.
2　Case analysis
2.1　Zhangbei-Shangyi earthquake disaster
　　On January 10,1998,a 6.2 Richter scale earthquake broke out at the joining region of Zhangbei-Shangyi counties in Hebei Province.According to the investigation of anti-earthquake office,the severe disaster area consisted of 37 administrativ e towns,585 administrative villages and 1824 natural villages.As a result,49 persons were dead,11479 persons were injured,and about 44 thousand people were homeless.The earthquake caused 136 thousand houses collapsed,254 thousand houses heavily destroyed.Some productive facilities were heavily damaged.Happened in und eveloped counties,the direct economic loss was very heavy relative to the local economy.Besides,Zhang bei county city and Zhangjiakou city were affected, too.
　　The epicenter of the earthquake is located at 41°1′ N and 114°3′E.The earthq uake source was 12.3 km ground under.The intensity of the epicenter is 8.The 8 intensity area is about 250km2, including most villages of five administrative towns where 65%～97% of the houses collapsed and the other heavily damaged.As t o the magnitude of the earthquake itself,it can not be said to be the most serio us in the history of Hebei Provine or China,but the conseq uence of the disaster is overwhelming.This presents us a challenging question.Wh y?What′s the basic reason?According to the analysis of building quality,structu res,sites in addition to the local citizen′s knowledge about earthquake,the bas ic reason lie s in the vulnerability existing in people and buildings.Intervening conditions l ike severe cold winter weather added an extra burden and aggravated the casualty .
2.2　Damaging forms and vulnerability in Zhangbei-Shang yi disaster
2.2.1　Building Structures and Vulnerability
　　Generally,the primary or direct damage is the collapse and destruction of built structures.Other direct impact is due to the loss of bearing capacity and slope failure of the ground surface.Being a semi-arid,less densely populated rural are a,deaths and injuries and losses in Zhangbei-Shangyi earthquake disaster are mai nly from direct impact.This is greatly different from that of densely populate d urban areas where the destroying of lifeline projects and fires often produce secondary and tertiary damages.In Zhangbei-Shangyi earthquake disaster,vulnerabi lity acted as ‘spatial filters’of the risk,and was crucial to damage and injur y.
　　The buildings in 8 intensity area can be broadly classified into five categorids :brick-stone,brick-wood,adobe-wood,brick-concrete and brick-arch structures.Farm houses are mainly brick-stone,brick-wood,adobe-wood structures〔1〕.Public buildings like schools,hospitals and supply-marketing buildings are of brick-wo od,brick-concrete and brick-arch strctures.The damaging situation is as follow:
　　(1) Brick-stone structure farm-houses:This is the most heavily collapsed category.The weight bearing walls were built of pieces of 40 cm width stones without pe ctic materials.The outer sides of the walls are 11.5 cm thick heat preservation bricks.The purlins of the buildings were put on the inner separating walls.The r oof of the buildings is made of mud and timber.Because of the lack of effective adhere nce of every part,the houses are easy to collapse when ground shakes.The injur y and death rate are much higher in this kind of dwellings.
　　(2) Adobe-wood structure farm houses:This kind of dwellings collapsed severely a lso.The bearing walls of this kind of houses are made of adobe.The roofs are made of a thick layer of mud and wood.Adobe has a very low resistant strength to shaking and are easy to be ruined.So it was another main source of deaths and in juries.
　　(3) Brick-wood structure houses:This kind of houses was less severely damaged t han the above two kinds of structures.
　　(4) Brick-concrete structure houses:This kind of houses,built by families with better economic conditions,is not commonly seen in 8 intensity area.The damage of this category are moderate.
　　(5) The brick-arch structure building was only used for grain-storage.The damage is the collapse of some of the walls.Without person living in,there was no in jury occurred.
2.2.2　Social and economic vulnerability
　　For recent hundreds of years,Zhangbei-Shangyi district was free from earthquake disaster.Local people have no idea and knowledge about earthquake,which had neve r been disseminated to this remote undeveloped rural area.So,the local people had never thought of earthquake resistance and mitigation in dwellings.Ho uses were neither built nor maintained to resist earthquakes.Further more,the local peasan ts are still less wealthy.The average annual income is below 1 000 yuan RMB per person.The illiteracy ratio in adults is pretty high.In addition,the semi- arid plateau monsoon climate and special location determine that this area is ve ry cold and windy in winter.So most of the houses were built with thick walls and r oofs to resist wind and keep warm in cold severe winter.Being unable to afford g ood quality structural materials,most of the local peasants had to build their h ouses with materials easily available such as adobe bricks and stone by using tr aditional technique.That is to say,the style and overall quality of the dwellin gs are related to local knowledge,economy,custom and nat ural conditions.This is a kind of vulnerability derived from society and economy .
2.2.3　Building style,sites and vulnerability
　　Though the building materials are different,almost all of the houses have thick walls and heavy roofs to resist the severe cold wi nter weather and strong sandy winds.The designs are also of a similarity.The mos t popular pattern is 5-7 rooms of the dwelling lined in flat.The front walls are embedded with large windows.Lacking of effective connections between the walls and the diversity of unbalanced strength made the buildings very easy to b e destroyed by earthquake.
　　Besides,the dwellings were built on magmatic rocks along slope.The weathered slo pe rock foundations are not stable enough for the buildings.The depth of th e foundation was no more than 60 cm.This could magnify the earthquake influences and increase structure instability.
　　The tendency of emphasizing on ornament and belittling quality in newly built dw ellings is another severe problem.Some new rich peasants ornamented the fron t wall of their houses with beautiful ceramic tiles spending great deal of money ,while neglected the property of integral weight-bearing walls.
　　To a certain degree,the vulnerability exposed in the disaster reflected the local ‘building culture’.This involves construction materials available and thei r costs,economic activity,the history and modern transformation of construction te chnique,and customary or fashion preferences.
2.2.4　Individual property and vulnerability
　　In western countries,people′s vulnerability has a great deal to do with age,gen d er,race,ethnicity,religion,social status,political rights etc..It is believed th at the people or groups of ability have to “anticipate,cope with,resist,and recover from the impact of natural hazards” and has a lot to do with how and to what exte nt they can gain access to kinds of resources. The commonly seen discrimina tions in the whole process of disaster preparedness,mitigation and relief severe ly affects resources′ allocation.In our country,every nation and person enjoys equal rights and freedom.So,there is no vulnerability resulted from discriminati on.Whereas age,health status,as individual property,play a large role in deaths and injuries despite the great care for the weakened groups.Moreover,knowledge l evel severely restrained the ability to cope with hazard.Largely,poverty and und erdevelopment is the root of vulnerability.
2.2.5　Disaster preparedness,relief and vulnerability
　　Shortly after the earthquake happened,the governments at all levels and the Peo ple′s Liberation Army took part in the emergency response and disaster mitiga tio n work.Thanks to the timely responses,further injuries and losses were decreased as much as possible.Through the effort of local people and our government and w ith the assistance from home and abroad,Rehabilitation and reconstruction were d one to reduce future risk.Yet,there were problems like insufficiency of local co mmunity′s preparedness.when the event occurred abruptly,the local community had not enough materials to provide the victims.Large quantity of food,shelter and c olthing were transported from outside.
3　Lessons we should learn
　　The vulnerability exposed in Zhangbei-Shangyi earthquake disaster gave us a good lesson.The recognition of the problem is helpful for the future prevention ,r eduction and mitigation of earthquake disaster.
　　Most of deaths,injuries and damages are from direct destruction of buildings and infrastructures in earthquake disasters.Residential buildings are always among t he severity.Hence reinforcement of the pre-code buildings and build new anti-ear thquake structures are the direct measures to reduce earthquake impacts.
　　What deserve much attention is that anti-earthquake building codes and regulatio ns have already been worked and being carried out in urban areas.Earthquake self -relief knowledge dissemination are also windespread.While in the broad rural ar eas country people seem know less about anti-earthquake structure and technique. They lack knowledge about premonitor and self-relief.Therefore widesprea d ea rthquake education and dissemination are absolute necessary in rural areas.It is necessary for our government to draw out some money to carry out detail researc h work and design suitable building structures for different seismic areas and p rovide them with free charge.Any way,the cost of pre-disaster management is much less than that of relief and reconstruction.Here, we must emphasize that withou t effective enforcement,building code is worthless.Prevention of newly built stru ctures′ vulnerability induced by curruption is also very important in urban are as.
　　Land-use planning is another effective adjustment way to reduce and mitigate ear thquake impacts.A good land use planning and its enforcement can avoid unsafe lo cations.Then secondary and tertiary disasters caused by landslide,river dam fail ure,leaking of exotic and poisonous materials in earthquake can be reduced at be st.
　　Good preparedness means less losses and deaths.In view of the severity of seism ic activity in Hebei Province,it is necessary to carry out a systematic analyses and assessment of earthquake disaster risk and vulnerability.A series of emerge ncy plans should be worked out based on the scientific assessment.Sufficient sup plies should be stored.In case an earthquake occurs there will be no disorderlin ess.
　　In a summary,the earthquake events are natural.Yet the earthquake disasters are the complex mixture of hazards and vulnerability.We can do a lot to reduce and m itigate eaerthquake disaster impacts through the minimization of vulnerability.
